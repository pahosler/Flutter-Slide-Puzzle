/// A leaf node in the focus tree that can receive focus.
///
/// The focus tree keeps track of which widget is the user's current focus. The
/// focused widget often listens for keyboard events.
///
/// To request focus, find the [FocusScopeNode] for the current [BuildContext]
/// and call the [FocusScopeNode.requestFocus] method:
///
/// ```dart
/// FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(focusNode);
/// ```
///
/// If your widget requests focus, be sure to call
/// `FocusScope.of(context).reparentIfNeeded(focusNode);` in your `build`
/// method to reparent your [FocusNode] if your widget moves from one
/// location in the tree to another.
///
/// ## Lifetime
///
/// Focus nodes are long-lived objects. For example, if a stateful widget has a
/// focusable child widget, it should create a [FocusNode] in the
/// [State.initState] method, and [dispose] it in the [State.dispose] method,
/// providing the same [FocusNode] to the focusable child each time the
/// [State.build] method is run. In particular, creating a [FocusNode] each time
/// [State.build] is invoked will cause the focus to be lost each time the
/// widget is built.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [FocusScopeNode], which is an interior node in the focus tree.
///  * [FocusScope.of], which provides the [FocusScopeNode] for a given
///    [BuildContext].
